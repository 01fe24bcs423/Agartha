    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The Agartha Smart City project outlines a strategic plan for urban development that balances profitability and sustainability. This includes:
        <ul>
            <li><h3>What is the course about?</h3></li>
                <li>The course teaches us about, how to create algorithms to solve problems and make them run efficiently. We study different ways to design algorithms, pick the right data structures, and figure out how fast or slow they might be. The course covers topics like sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and graph algorithms. Basically, it's about understanding how algorithms work and how to improve them to solve real-life problems more effectively.</li>
            <li><h3>What kind of data structures and algorithms have you studied?</h3></li>
                <li>In the course there are data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables. For algorithms, we've learned sorting techniques (like QuickSort and MergeSort), searching methods (Binary and Linear Search), dynamic programming (e.g., Fibonacci, Knapsack), greedy algorithms (like Huffman coding), and graph algorithms (such as Dijkstra's, BFS, and DFS). These concepts help in solving computational problems efficiently.</li>
            <li><h3>How do you connect the course with real time applications?</h3></li>
               <li> The course with real time applications
                <li>1. Sorting/Search Algorithms: Used in databases, search engines, and e-commerce.</li>
                <li> 2. Dynamic Programming: Applied in optimization, AI, and resource management.</li>
                <li>3. Graph Algorithms: Essential for network analysis, GPS, and social media.</li>
        </ul>
