    <h1>Course Project Introduction</h1>
    <p>Our project, Agartha, focuses on sustainable urban living, enhancing infrastructure while maintaining environmental balance.</p>
    <li><h3>Provide the details of problem space and how it was arrived at. Summarize the
        findings from white paper. Reflect on city design and how business cases were
        identified.</h3></li>
        <li>The problem space refers to the challenges of city faces, such as traffic or sustainability issues. It is identified through data analysis, stakeholder input, and research. The  highlight key problems (e.g., inefficient infrastructure) and propose solutions like improved public transport or green building designs. City design focuses on creating functional, livable spaces by balancing infrastructure, sustainability, and accessibility. Business cases are identified by assessing the economic benefits and costs of projects, such as how better transportation can boost businesses and improve quality of life</li>
    <li><h3>Provide problem definition.</h3>
       <li> The city is dealing with heavy traffic, not enough public transportation, and pollution, which makes commuting longer and worsens the environment. The current infrastructure is old and doesn’t meet the needs of the growing population. We need better planning to make the city more efficient, eco-friendly, and easier to live in, with better transportation options and improved air quality.</li>
    <li><h3>Provide business cases that each member is working on.</h3>                                           <li>   Member 1 - Sustainable Infrastructure:
        Business Case: Propose eco-friendly infrastructure solutions, such as green buildings, solar energy, and waste recycling programs. This plan focuses on reducing the city’s carbon footprint while saving money in the long term through energy efficiency and sustainability.</li>
        <li>Member 2 - Smart City Technology:
        Business Case: Implement smart city technologies like traffic management systems, smart lighting, and data-driven decision-making tools. This would improve city operations, reduce energy costs, and create a more connected and efficient urban environment for both residents and businesses</li>
